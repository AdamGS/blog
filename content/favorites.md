# My Favorite Things

A somewhat organized lists of things I like - blogs, papers, books etc. I'm trying to add things and this is in no way comprehensive list.

## Blogs

- [Phil Eaton](https://eatonphil.com/)'s fantastic blog. He has a great knack for communicating a huge range of highly technical topics, and also does great work encouraging others to do so.

## Papers

- [Fair benchmarks considered difficult](https://hannes.muehleisen.org/publications/DBTEST2018-performance-testing.pdf) - I think this paper should be the starting point for every cross-system benchmark.
- [Exploiting Cloud Object Storage for High-Performance Analytics](https://www.durner.dev/app/media/papers/anyblob-vldb23.pdf) - I think this paper really opened up a bunch of ways of thinking for me, mostly about how to approach cloud systems and problems.
- [Procella](https://research.google/pubs/procella-unifying-serving-and-analytical-data-at-youtube/) - Youtube's data warehouse. I feel like the density of ideas in this paper is extremely high, from the file format they describe to the overall system. As usual, Google's internal systems seem to be a few years ahead of the rest of us.

## Books
