# Adam Gutglick

This is my personal website, which main purpose is to help my keep track of things I want to showcase and
host some random written thoughts.

I'm a software engineer, originally from Israel and currently in London.

I currently work for [Spiral](https://spiraldb.com/), mostly focused on [Vortex](https://github.com/spiraldb/vortex), a new columnar file format for modern workloads.
